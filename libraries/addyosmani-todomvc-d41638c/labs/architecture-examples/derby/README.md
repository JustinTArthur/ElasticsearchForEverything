## Getting started

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (>=0.8.0) is required to run this app.


### Run the app

`make run`

This will install the dependencies locally, compile the CoffeScript and run
the demo server for you.


### Play with the code

In one window, run `make` which will continue to compile the CoffeScript as
you save changes. In a separate window run `node server.js` and open up the
shown URL.
