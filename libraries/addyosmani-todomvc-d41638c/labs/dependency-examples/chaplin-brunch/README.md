# Brunch with Chaplin TODOMVC
Brunch with Chaplin is a skeleton (boilerplate) for [Brunch](http://brunch.io)
based on [Chaplin](https://github.com/chaplinjs/chaplin) framework.

The application is based on the skeleton.

## Getting started
* Install [Brunch](http://brunch.io) if you hadn’t already (`npm install -g brunch`).
* Execute `npm install` in the root directory once.
* Execute `brunch build` in the root directory to build app every time. That’s all.
* Execute `brunch watch` if you want to continiously rebuild the app
on every change. To run the app then, you will need to open `public/index.html` in your browser (assuming the root is `/todomvc/` root or so).
